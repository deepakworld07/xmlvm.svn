This is a github clone of the XMLVM project:

	http://www.xmlvm.org

You may want to watch this Google TechTalk video about XMLVM by Arno Puder:

This repo is a git-svn clone of:

	 https://xmlvm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmlvm

Essentially, this:

	git svn clone https://xmlvm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmlvm

It may or may not be kept in svn sync with a periodic "git svn fetch".

Note: I am _NOT_ a xmlvm maintainer, or even a contributor (yet).

If anything, I am but a user.

This is my personal clone of this project.

The aboid/ folder is an extraction of this:

Enjoy!
